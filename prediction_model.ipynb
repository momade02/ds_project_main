    "We build a route-aware refueling recommender for Germany that forecasts station-level prices at the ETA and then optimizes “where/when to stop (and how much to buy)” by trading cheaper price vs. detour/time and fuel constraints. The pipeline ingests historical + live data, enriches with routing/ETA, weather, holidays, and macro signals, and serves uncertainty-aware recommendations via a FastAPI backend and an interactive Streamlit map. Everything is fully automated, validated, and documented in a reproducible repo, with the app hosted on the bwCloud."
